# Tic Tac Toe React
## Overview
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe web application built using React. It allows two players to take turns and play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. The game keeps track of the player's turns, announces the winner, and prevents invalid moves.

## Features
React Components: React concepts such as thinking in components, useState hook, useEffect hook, prop drilling. The app is structured using React components for better code organization and reusability.

Also covered JS audio, CSS concepts such as flex-box and grid for display and more to create a delightful UI.

State Management: The state of the game is managed using React's built-in state to keep track of the game board, current player, and winner.

Turn-based Gameplay: Players take turns to make their moves. The game alternates between 'X' and 'O', and the board updates accordingly.

Winning Logic: The app checks for a winning condition after each move and declares the winner if there is one. It also handles a draw if the board is full without a winner.

## Usage

Install dependencies: npm install
Start the app: npm start
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to play the game.
