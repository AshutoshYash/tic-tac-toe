#Tic Tac Toe React Web App
Overview
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe web application built using React. It allows two players to take turns and play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. The game keeps track of the player's turns, announces the winner, and prevents invalid moves.

Features
React Components: The app is structured using React components for better code organization and reusability.

State Management: The state of the game is managed using React's built-in state to keep track of the game board, current player, and winner.

Turn-based Gameplay: Players take turns to make their moves. The game alternates between 'X' and 'O', and the board updates accordingly.

Winning Logic: The app checks for a winning condition after each move and declares the winner if there is one. It also handles a draw if the board is full without a winner.
